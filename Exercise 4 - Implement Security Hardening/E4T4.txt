# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Put the web application in a Private subnet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Creating VPC private endpoints will only control access for other networks, but if someone gains access to an instance they will still be able to access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, only to new objects.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All resources will go to the original state.
